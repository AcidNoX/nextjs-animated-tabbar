# nextjs-animated-tabbar

This is my implementation of [u/APthreads](https://www.reddit.com/user/APthreads/)' [Navbar animation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterEffects/comments/ovto7x/navbar_animation_inside_of_after_effects/).
100% of the credit goes to u/APthreads for the design.

I feel this is a relatively accurate approximation of the design. I've had to compromise with the rounded clip paths I don't have enough experience with SVG path commands to get the right shapes. I think lottie might be required to get that looking perfect.

Key libraries used:
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
* [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
